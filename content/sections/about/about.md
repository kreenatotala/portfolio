Hello! My name is Kreena, and I am an aspiring software engineer in Boston, MA. 

I am a Data Science and Behavioral Neuroscience student at Northeastern University. Some of my biggest interests are machine learning and artifical intelligence, and how they can be applied to different domains in conjuction with data analysis to draw meaningful and interesting conclusions. I am also fascinated by human cognition; essentially, why we act and think the way that we do. I strive to acheive a deep undertsanding of human behavior, as much of data analysis revolves around predicting human behavior. 

My goal is to use my problem-solving skills and my passion for programming to integrate these interests and create effective and elgant software solutions that revolutionize our understanding of the world around us.  

Some of my other interests are science fiction, digital art & design, traveling, reading, baking, and music. See what cool stuff I'm currently up to <a href="/now" ><u>here</u></a> :)
